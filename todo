# DishConfig's TODO

- Put patches into it's own version. Maybe a git branch, or file directory. snapshots/{version} release/{version}.
- Need to make this automatically generate a workspace, so that way, I can easily fix patches
  - When doing this, I want it to grab the correct versions for it's dependencies.
  - I want to also grab the assets and data dirs
- Implement a way to clean cache.
- Update generatePatches.js to support versioning
