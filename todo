# DishConfig's TODO

- Implement a way to clean cache.
- Update the way that patches are applied and generated.
  - I want to create the workspace, then move the files into the src/main/java directory. Then, apply the patch there.
  - With this, I also want to generate the patches from that directory. Will skip the step of keeping the decompiled directory when it truly isn't needed anymore.
- Add a README.md file to document how this works
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file so contributors will know what to do
- Move all the decompile code into it's own package, so that I can use this on other stuff
- Add tests (maybe JUnit?) to workspaces
- Make a dish/compile.js file to compile and bundle the dish server jar
