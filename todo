# DishConfig's TODO

- Implement a way to clean cache.
- Add a README.md file to document how this works
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file so contributors will know what to do
- Add tests (maybe JUnit?) to workspaces
- Make patches/decompile-errors/generatePatches work like patches/generatePatches. If I need to fix another error inside the file, it will just overwrite it.
