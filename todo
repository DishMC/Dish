# DishConfig's TODO

- Implement a way to clean cache.
- Update generatePatches.js to support versioning
- Update the way that patches are applied and generated.
  - I want to create the workspace, then move the files into the src/main/java directory. Then, apply the patch there.
  - With this, I also want to generate the patches from that directory. Will skip the step of keeping the decompiled directory when it truly isn't needed anymore.
